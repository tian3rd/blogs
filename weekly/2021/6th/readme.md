## A Short Retrospective of First Few Weeks in 2021

> When there is no enemy within, the enemies outside cannot hurt you. -African Proverb

After the first six weeks of errors and trials, there is one fundamental rule that matters the most: set up a minimum doable routine tasks, and keep it going. For now, I find it reasonable to dedicate _6 hours_ every day to meet this expectation of myself. 2 hours for coding, 2 hours for cs reading, 1 hour for reviewing, and 1 hour for reading, these are the daily fundamentals I need to keep working on every single day, no exeptions.

As you see, I used to set such a high bar that working towards that goal for a few days will exhaust me, resulting in an inevitable breakdown afterwards. Ideally, one can spend 10 hours' quality time or even more studying, or polishing up his skills every day. But the thing is, I'm not like 8 or 10 years ago when I can push and test my limits. I need to adjust myself to the new situations. Try to settle with an older version of myself is the first step when path ahead of me is not a sprint any more, but more of a marathon.

Naturally, one can feel lost by repetitions. To spice things up, I set up some projects for a change of pace. The topics and projects are also a reminder that, this is a world of so many more opportunites and it's worth fighting for.
