There is no shortcut to mastering the techniques. In my calculation, it takes me about an hour to go through ten pages of a technical book such as _The C Programming Language_ or _Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective_. If a book ranges from 200 pages to 400 pages in general, then it'll take 20 to 40 hours to read it. So in average, if I devote one hour a day, then I'll finish in one month. Fair enough.

As you can see, the accumulation of knowledge is more or less linear to to time you spend, at least in the beginning of a progrmmer's career.
