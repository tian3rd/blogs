### Febuary Guide

#### As a programmer

There is no shortcut to mastering the techniques. In my calculation, it takes me about an hour[^1] to go through ten pages of a technical book such as _The C Programming Language_ or _Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective_. If a book ranges from 200 pages to 400 pages in general, then it'll take 20 to 40 hours to read it. So in average, if I devote one hour a day, then I'll finish in one month. Fair enough.

As you can see, the accumulation of knowledge is more or less linear to to time you spend, at least in the beginning of a progrmmer's career. Just a few days ago, I decided that as a rookie programmer, the minimum efforts were two hours' textbook reading and two hours' hands-on coding. In this spirit, for the rest of Febuary, I can finish up two books as a head start. The one I'm working on is _The C Programming Language_ in that it is the foundation of a large segment of the computer science kingdom. Another one I'm keen on reviewing is _Core Java: Volumn I_, because Java is said to be the _strongest_ industrial language so far but I get rusty at it.

Apart from the fundamentals, it is vital for a programmer to see the big picture as well as mind the details. For the big picture, the book _CSAPP_ is a good start to get acquainted with the principles and structures in the computer system. As for the details, _Code Complete_ comes as a solid handbook. Besides, the hands-on practice is of great importance for me to really master what I've learnt. Coding to solve some interview problems is one effective way to apply the abstract algorithms and build up skills. On the other hand, _Spring Boot In Action_ is a good book to peek into how the industry framwork works as I explore Java.

SO, here is the booklist for myself:

- [The C Programming Language]()
- [Core Java: Volumn I]()
- [Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective]()
- [Code Complete]()
- [Spring Boot In Action]()

#### As a citizen

Start from a good book. First pay my debts to the past. The following three books are on my bookshelf long enough, and it is high time I took time to read it and hopefully, can come up with a review afterwards.

- [Shoe Dog]()
- [Common Sense]()
- [Against the Gods: The Remarkable Story of Risk]()
