[Samsung SSD](https://www.kogan.com/au/buy/samsung-t7-portable-ssd-drive-500gb-grey-samsung/)

That's a lightweight monster to free up my MBP. Also installed kali and MX Linux on separate partitions in this SSD. In a place with poor internet connection, nothing beats the local perfomances and stability of an SSD.

[Ethical hacking by Tom Webb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp25LmdYlds)
"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. --Arthur C. Clarke"
In my point of view, hacking is a neutral word where it can be used to exploit intelligence, or used as a tool to exploit others. In some way, it's like the new break-in of last centuries. One way or another, one may get hacked if he is exposed in the society. As a defensive strategy, he must know hacking and better get hands on the real hacking, then he can protect what's important in the virtually connected world. Along the journey, it's much fun and risky.

[Ridley Scott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridley_Scott)'s movies cover a variety of topics ranging from historic adpatations, science fiction to military events and current affairs. I watched a documentary about [Alien](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078748/)'s [behind-the-scene clips](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8974964/?) earlier this year, when the director was in his early career. He is such a pioneer and solid director. I just bought a bargin colletions of four moview on iTunes:

[2 set violin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a315S3_JtZ8)

This channel brings some light entertainment in the music world from two funny guys who actually are great violin players. When I'm feeling tired, I'd sometime switch to this channel to enjoy the critics of music perfomances from these two. The above link is one that I like the most. It's really enlightning to test the limit of human performances.

[Maccy](https://github.com/p0deje/Maccy)

An open-source clipboard tool for easy copy/paste on Mac. (Another option is to use Alfred.app built-in tool to do the same basic clipborad management, but it is in the power pack which costs around $40; I used to use the old version of another app Paste, but it's asked users to subscribe to the services even if you've already bought it long before the subscription mode.)

Features:

- Lightweight and fast
- Keyboard-first Secure and private
- Native UI
- Open source and free

It really takes time (hopefully 10 years) to be good at programming. Can't rush it. Put the hard work, and practice coding whenever you can.

[missing semester](https://missing.csail.mit.edu)

> Classes teach you all about advanced topics within CS, from operating systems to machine learning, but there’s one critical subject that’s rarely covered, and is instead left to students to figure out on their own: proficiency with their tools. We’ll teach you how to master the command-line, use a powerful text editor, use fancy features of version control systems, and much more!
> Students spend hundreds of hours using these tools over the course of their education (and thousands over their career), so it makes sense to make the experience as fluid and frictionless as possible. Mastering these tools not only enables you to spend less time on figuring out how to bend your tools to your will, but it also lets you solve problems that would previously seem impossibly complex.

Highly recommended to get your hands crafty and dirty!

- [Vocabulary](https://www.vocabulary.com)
  - This is a practice and word lookup site. I've just used for a while.

Some facts about a foreigner's mastery of vocabulary vs native speakers:

- In general, most native English adult speakers who have taken the test fall in the range 22000-35000 words. [[Details](http://testyourvocab.com/blog/2013-05-08-Native-speakers-in-greater-detail#newMainchartNative)]
- For foreign learners of English, most common vocabulary size is from 2500-9000 words. [[Details](http://testyourvocab.com/blog/2011-07-25-New-results-for-foreign-learners#mainchartNonnative)]

It tells a fascinating story illustrating the trades and market rules, with prisoners as buyer, sellor, middlemen and organiser, etc.
Some amusing facts:

- Cigarettes are treated as currency;
- Flututations of prices (inflations and deflations) by supply and demand periodically, or sometimes war events;
- Middlemen are generally hated but everyone has to deal with them;
- Embryo labour market to perform services such as laundries;
- Paper currency for bully marks;
- Shop as a bank of issue;

As a programmer, I often get lost when new techs are emerging so rapidly in the industry. Therefore, how to enjoy coding while also grow as a developer is an imminent problem facing me right now. Chen Hao is a Chinese programmer who knows his trade with years of experience mudding in the industry, who I can call as a tide player. His blog covers not only tech skills, but also provide insightful ideas about a programmer's career. Beware that it's a Chinese website.

Rating: ⭑⭑⭑⭑

This pomodoro timer is simple yet elegant for tracking the time and reminding. I am currently using the _Sync to hour_ mode instead of the _25+5_ default setting, partly because 25 minutes seems a bit too short and while I get distracted a lot.

By the way, I find this app on this awesome repo: [Awesome Mac Apps](https://github.com/jaywcjlove/awesome-mac).

[卧虎藏龙原声带 Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon - Orignal Motion Picture Soundtrack](https://music.apple.com/us/album/crouching-tiger-hidden-dragon-original-motion-picture/1035012026)

Ratings: ⭑⭑⭑⭑⭑

This masterpiece album brought by Tan Dun, Yo-yo Ma and Shanghai National Orchestra is so amazing that the first few seconds of the first piece has already given me goosebumps. Even as an amateur, I can relive some clips of the movie with the guidance of the doleful melody. Different instruments interweave and reverberate across the album, with each playing its part to bring out delicate yet touching emotions. The theme song performed by Coco is also breaking my heart. Coco is stunning at both the orignal Chinese song and the English version. By the way, the names of the songs are also great translations from Chinese which I can't help but share them here:

1. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon 卧虎藏龙
2. The Eternal Vow 永恒的誓约
3. A Wedding Interrupted 闹婚
4. Night Fight 夜门
5. Silk Road 丝绸之路
6. To the South 南行
7. Through the Bamboo Forest 穿越竹林
8. The Encounter 交锋
9. Desert Capriccio 荒漠奇情
10. In the Old Temple 古寺
11. Yearning of the Sword 思慕青冥剑
12. Sorrow 悲
13. Farewell 离
14. A Love Before Time / 月光爱人

[Kmart 11 Fin Oil Heater](https://www.kmart.com.au/product/11-fin-oil-heater/2903324)

An oil heater is a connvection heater filled with oil (used as a heat buffer because of high boiling point and hight specific heat capacity). It's fin-shaped to maximize the surface area of the radiator.

Ratings: ⭑⭑⭑⭐︎
Works like a charm in a small room! A must-have to spend your autumn/winter in Canberra!

_Downside_

- Power source is as high as **2400W** for a 11-fin oil heater (power is proportional to fin numbers)
- Efficiency is relatively low

### 08-04-2021[poem]

**Funeral Blues** <br> by _W.H. Auden_ <br>
Stop all the clocks, cut off the telephone, prevent the dog from barking with a jucy bone, silence the pianos and with muffled drum, bring out the coffin, let the mouners come. <br>
Let aeroplanes circle moaning overhead, scribbling on the sky the message 'He is Dead'. <br>
Put crepe bows round the white necks of the public doves, let the traffic policemen wear black cotton gloves. <br>
He was my North, my South, my East and West, my working week and Sunday rest, my noon, my midnight, my talk, my song; I thought that love would last forever: I was wrong. <br>
The stars are not wanted now; put out every one, pack up the moon and dismantle the sun, pour away the ocean and sweep up the wood; for nothing now can ever come to any good.

## How it began...

Now it may be worth a while to share here a specific product here just to refresh a little bit. It may be a useful app that meets a specific need, or it may be command line tool that's worth trying for a laborous task, or it may be a neglected foreign film that's inpiring, or it may be a quiet place for the weekend, or it may be a book with a heartwarming story... Literally, the possibilities are endless. And it's easy to maintain with the following table as an example:
