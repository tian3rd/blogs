## How it goes

### 16-04-2021[paper]

[The Economic Organisation of a POW camp](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/2550133.pdf?casa_token=GRoB1njEzoEAAAAA:_3YN9ww6MYAhNoXHiw9IwXOD57xhm6db2CR9flgr0NUP2LaX7WRL0xxJDS7MwS8ewrvTOMFpGGVGl1rJnzJ2rmgMtXU4kMYWIdJ_nGSChSasr9IlMbtg) is a paper regarding how economics works in a camp during the WWII. It tells a fascinating story illustrating the trades and market rules, with prisoners as buyer, sellor, middlemen and organiser, etc.
Some amusing facts:

- Cigarettes are treated as currency;
- Flututations of prices (inflations and deflations) by supply and demand periodically, or sometimes war events;
- Middlemen are generally hated but everyone has to deal with them;
- Embryo labour market to perform services such as laundries;
- Paper currency for bully marks;
- Shop as a bank of issue;
- ...

As a programmer, I often get lost when new techs are emerging so rapidly in the industry. Therefore, how to enjoy coding while also grow as a developer is an imminent problem facing me right now. Chen Hao is a Chinese programmer who knows his trade with years of experience mudding in the industry, who I can call as a tide player. His blog covers not only tech skills, but also provide insightful ideas about a programmer's career. Beware that it's a Chinese website.

Frankly said, got some kind of immune to the non-linearity of Quentin's tricks. Still, everyone knows his/her trade, with round of applause to Samuel Jackson, damn!

This pomodoro timer is simple yet elegant for tracking the time and reminding. I am currently using the _Sync to hour_ mode instead of the _25+5_ default setting, partly because 25 minutes seems a bit too short and while I get distracted a lot.

By the way, I find this app on this awesome repo: [Awesome Mac Apps](https://github.com/jaywcjlove/awesome-mac).

[卧虎藏龙原声带 Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon - Orignal Motion Picture Soundtrack](https://music.apple.com/us/album/crouching-tiger-hidden-dragon-original-motion-picture/1035012026)

Ratings: ⭑⭑⭑⭑⭑

This masterpiece album brought by Tan Dun, Yo-yo Ma and Shanghai National Orchestra is so amazing that the first few seconds of the first piece has already given me goosebumps. Even as an amateur, I can relive some clips of the movie with the guidance of the doleful melody. Different instruments interweave and reverberate across the album, with each playing its part to bring out delicate yet touching emotions. The theme song performed by Coco is also breaking my heart. Coco is stunning at both the orignal Chinese song and the English version. By the way, the names of the songs are also great translations from Chinese which I can't help but share them here:

1. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon 卧虎藏龙
2. The Eternal Vow 永恒的誓约
3. A Wedding Interrupted 闹婚
4. Night Fight 夜门
5. Silk Road 丝绸之路
6. To the South 南行
7. Through the Bamboo Forest 穿越竹林
8. The Encounter 交锋
9. Desert Capriccio 荒漠奇情
10. In the Old Temple 古寺
11. Yearning of the Sword 思慕青冥剑
12. Sorrow 悲
13. Farewell 离
14. A Love Before Time / 月光爱人

### 10-04-2021[appliance]

[Kmart 11 Fin Oil Heater](https://www.kmart.com.au/product/11-fin-oil-heater/2903324)

An oil heater is a connvection heater filled with oil (used as a heat buffer because of high boiling point and hight specific heat capacity). It's fin-shaped to maximize the surface area of the radiator.

Ratings: ⭑⭑⭑⭐︎
Works like a charm in a small room! A must-have to spend your autumn/winter in Canberra!

_Downside_

- Power source is as high as **2400W** for a 11-fin oil heater (power is proportional to fin numbers)
- Efficiency is relatively low

### 08-04-2021[poem]

**Funeral Blues** <br> by _W.H. Auden_ <br>
Stop all the clocks, cut off the telephone, prevent the dog from barking with a jucy bone, silence the pianos and with muffled drum, bring out the coffin, let the mouners come. <br>
Let aeroplanes circle moaning overhead, scribbling on the sky the message 'He is Dead'. <br>
Put crepe bows round the white necks of the public doves, let the traffic policemen wear black cotton gloves. <br>
He was my North, my South, my East and West, my working week and Sunday rest, my noon, my midnight, my talk, my song; I thought that love would last forever: I was wrong. <br>
The stars are not wanted now; put out every one, pack up the moon and dismantle the sun, pour away the ocean and sweep up the wood; for nothing now can ever come to any good.

The poem is read in its entirety in [Four weddings and a Funeral](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109831/) starting from 1:26:55.

## How it began...

Now it may be worth a while to share here a specific product here just to refresh a little bit. It may be a useful app that meets a specific need, or it may be command line tool that's worth trying for a laborous task, or it may be a neglected foreign film that's inpiring, or it may be a quiet place for the weekend, or it may be a book with a heartwarming story... Literally, the possibilities are endless. And it's easy to maintain with the following table as an example:

**BOOK**: [Can't Hurt Me](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41721428-can-t-hurt-me)

Recommendation: First I was drawn by the feat done by the author when I saw a video about him on Youtube. Until today, I finally pick up the book, and the story is even more inspiring.
