## How it goes

### 08-04-2021[poem]

**Funeral Blues** <br> by _W.H. Auden_ <br>
Stop all the clocks, cut off the telephone, prevent the dog from barking with a jucy bone, silence the pianos and with muffled drum, bring out the coffin, let the mouners come. <br>
Let aeroplanes circle moaning overhead, scribbling on the sky the message 'He is Dead'. <br>
Put crepe bows round the white necks of the public doves, let the traffic policemen wear black cotton gloves. <br>
He was my North, my South, my East and West, my working week and Sunday rest, my noon, my midnight, my talk, my song; I thought that love would last forever: I was wrong. <br>
The stars are not wanted now; put out every one, pack up the moon and dismantle the sun, pour away the ocean and sweep up the wood; for nothing now can ever come to any good.

Recommendation: First I was drawn by the feat done by the author when I saw a video about him on Youtube. Until today, I finally pick up the book, and the story is even more inspiring.
