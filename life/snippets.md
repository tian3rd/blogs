1. An idea for an app
   When I glanced at the iPhone homescreen today, there was a portion of the picture I took, but I could not recognize it. I had some guesses, but until I opened up the widget, I could not know for sure. So here's the idea, it's like finding waldo, but in a different sense. If I gave you a corner of the object, how can you know what it is or where it is from or ...?
   Another thing is that can you be creative? Like CNN can learn the patterns, and predict the labels. But can it be trained to have more freedom?

2. The habit that shapes us
