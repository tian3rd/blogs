## Trouble always comes, just _deal with it_

> I came to the reception to ask for key card of my previous room, only to find that all my stuff got thrown away, for good. 

This **Monday**, I tried to collect my belongings from my previous room, but when I got in, nothing was there. Most shockingly, my T-shirt in memory of Kobe which was pinned on the cork board was gone, and that was all I cared about at the moment. At first, I was hoping that they kept my stuff in the storage room, without thinking about why they got into my room in the first place. A day passed by, the promised investigation never came, so I had to go to the reception the third time just before 5:00 pm to ask for explanation. This time I finally got to meet one of the managers, who made another promise to investigate this matter fully and would get back to me on Thursday (because **Tuesday** was a public holiday, and they would ask the cleaners on **Wednesday**, so **Thursday** they could have an answer).

I went back on **Thursday**, naively hoping that they actually got an explanation and solution. But as it turned out, they didn't even bother until I reached to them again to ask for a result. So they finally made some efforts, while I was waiting in the lounge for more than one hour. The manager came out to me with a pile of pictures taken on the day of the cleanup. That helped me remember some of the things I left in that room. But I did not saw my T-shirt in that picture, because the cork board was facing down, I mean, what is the point of taking this picture? Is there anyone using the board to pin things actually want to take the board off the wall and pin stuff on the back? What a magic world! Then, the show began. He managed to print out the very email that he had claimed to prove to me that Unilodge notified me before throwing my things away. As he was reading that email, his voice lowered down because he sensed that something was wrong with that letter: it was actually a proof that Unilodge treated me as a departed resident, which was clearly a mistake. So the legal grounds he claimed were gone for good. Now it was my turn. I simply wanted him to explain that besides this irrelevant mail, how could I get my stuff back? Since he mentioned to me that they usually stored the stuff for months, and my only goal was to get my T-shirt back, I wanted to speak to someone who could actually sort up this trifling matter. No luck. So he proposed to arrange a meeting for me and his manager who would be in charge on **Friday**. For the fifth time, I believed him. 

So, here comes today's fifty-minute-long meeting. My roommate comes together with me because he's also lost some documents including his driving licence issued in Malaysia. I recorded this meeting of four (two managers and two residents) , and I have to say, they are so incompetent and inefficient that I highly doubt the managing skills of their titles. The conversation is more like a English speaking practice for me, in which I have to add some of my reasoning, arguments and evidence to spice things up. Unfortunately, this recording is not for public or training purpose, otherwise it would've gone viral (bad joke 🤣). 

To make up for this, I included a _serious_ reply email as follows: 

> Thank you for the reply, ***!
>
> It’s such a long day!
> My main concerns and my thinkings are the followings:
>
> - According to the contract of the 2020 Residential Agreement Amendment I signed last April,
>
> - - “Unless otherwise agreed upon, this is a temporary move and you will be moved back at a later date (to be assessed later). As such, if so desired, you may leave some of your belongings in the previous room for storage however your access will be cut off after Tuesday 14 April 2020. Any future access will occur through reception and will be limited.”
>
> - So the belongings I left behind in my previous room ** are meant to be collected by me and me only. They are personal belongings that are not meant to be disposed by anyone else until the end of my contract (31/01/2021).
>
> - According to the Unilodge Handbook[^1], without reasonable grounds, Unilodge doesn’t have the right to enter my room. In my case, the Unilodge failed to check the fact that my roommate and I are still residents of Unilodge, and we are not departing till the end of the contract date 31/01/2021. Therefore, the email notifying the departed/departing residents of the cleanup is not relevant to my roommate and me, so there were no reasonable grounds, just the fact that Unilodge made a mistake and breached the contract, and we had to bear the consequences.
>
> - As I said, it has been about nine months since I moved to UOCV. Memory fades away, so I can not be 100% sure of everything. Luckily, the staff took some photos to help me remember. Unfortunately, the pictures didn’t cover all my belongings (e.g. It did not take pictures of the bags on the top shelf of the wardrobe; and the cork board was facing down in the picture while my T-shirt was pinned on the front.)
>
> - Besides, there are some mistakes in the table of your email to me:
>
> - - There are actually two textbooks which I need this year for my course. The texts are in Chinese which I can read faster. It is not fair to convert the value of the books to Australian dollars, because to get another two copies would be very hard and time-consuming during this pandemic. Combining the postage fees from China to Australia and the time spent, it would be best to buy the corresponding or equivalent English versions for me to study with.
>   - The Kindle (not cover) doesn't have to be new, a second hand one will suffice, which will cost you less.
>
> - **However,** I feel exhausted to go over this issue time and time again and I don’t have enough time for this matter in the future. I hope Unilodge can take this kind of miscommunication seriously and prevent it from happening again. I will move out this Sunday (31/01/2021) and I have to focus on my new year goals from now on.
>
> - Considering the above reasons, I am willing to settle for the total amount of your suggestion $350. Previously, I submitted a Security Deposit Refund Form, so you can find my account and details in your files and computer system.

What a long day, indeed!
