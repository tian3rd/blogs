# My Job Perspectives (What is the dream job and why)

In the coming job-seeking season, I'd like to find a job in mobile app development such as [this](https://d.pr/8x8By5) advertised on [seek](https://www.seek.com.au). The opportunites in this area are ample and the technologies are evolving rapidly.

Although it sounds a bit corny, I believe the greatest advantage modern technology has brought to us is that it equips everyone with such a versatile yet powerful tool to try out ideas and create possibilities, without depending too much on raw materials as required in traditional industries. To be more specific, I used to work in a conventional engineering start-up company. The routine in the company usually requires we contact other companies to inquire about their products, arrange face-to-face meetings and buy their products to integrate into our system. With the unparalleled growth in mobile app development, not only have the cumbersome processes been simplified by the one-stop service on the mobile platform, but we can also cooperate in real-time whatever the distance is. Everyone can take advantage of the computational power within their phones and tablets to imagine and create freely. After all, what you hold in your hand is more powerful than the device NASA used to send astronauts to the moon.
