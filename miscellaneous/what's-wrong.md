# Get irritated

> I claim to be old enough to get angry, but there's always something that's bugging me.

I guess I'm still naive. The brave men realize the reality and harshness but still carry on, but I come across some assholes and get angry and frustrated. How can you keep calm? Take my group for example, one guy is so self-centered that he is unable to talk with people without condesending. But he's younger, that's the excuse I always give myself to let him go off the hook. But in the end, I feel like it's not helping.
