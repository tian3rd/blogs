# Hey, Man

> Has anything you've done made your life better? -[American History X](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120586/)

## What's up?

It's just another normal day. But something's wrong! You feel it, you taste the difference in the air, and you sense the way people look at you... Oh, yeah, better find out what's wrong in a quiet corner before something terrible happens. Actually, you find that it's all because your heart is missing. No big deal. You've been hollow for years since you betray yourself and blame others for their wrongdoings. But what's the matter? Is it because after all these years, you can feel that the life is going downwards and there's no hope? Or is there some part of you dying day by day? You feel like a ghost in the shell. Finally, the ghost is leaving, too.

Can't live like this. Can't fool myself any longer.

Do whatever you can to turn things around. Start building your legacy. Open your eyes and roll up your sleeves. Now. Every morning. Till the day you can't.
