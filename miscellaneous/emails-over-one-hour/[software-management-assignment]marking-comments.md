# An example of how school work wastes my time

> As Musk puts it, "college is basically for fun and to prove that you can do your chores, but they’re not for learning." Below is an email that took me over an hour to write.

Hi,

Thank you for your feedback on our group (Group10) assignment 1. However, some of the comments in the PDF are confusing , which leads to this email.

1. I have asked in the tutorial that if it is a good practice to include an introduction in our essay, even if the requirement word limit is under 800 words. The tutor said that it’s generally a good idea to follow the basic structure of "introduction, body, conclusion". I manage to limit this section under 10% words of our entire essay, however, feedback points out that "The introduction was long and perhaps redundant…" which is contradicting to what the tutor suggested.
2. By pointing out "Too many unecessary words"(typo in the original comment) without highlighting any of the "unecessary" words, I feel that it’s not fair to make such an argument. As a matter of fact, I ran this section with the uni ASK team, the instructor was OK with the wording and I changed some of the words after our discussion, as shown in the screenshot below: ![screenshot](https://cdn-std.droplr.net/files/acc_498334/DPnMDh)

3. This leads to another detail of the word "intriguing" which "Does not denote positive or negative feedback" according to the comment. But intriguing is basically a positive word that is similar to "interesting" which is in the rubric itself. However, "interesting" is a "vague" word, therefore, I changed it according to the advice.
4. "The 'Overall evaluation…' did not clearly articulate whether or the report covered key messages or not" is not accurate. Actually, the key message in the original report is there, but it is a bad example of being not concise and lacking main findings or suggestions, just like the examples given in the lecture slide of week 2. So I point this out by saying that "it’s not clear enough" and "can be improved by outlining main findings of the research".
5. The overall evaluation was organized strictly following the "Review Criteria" provided in the rubric, by pointing out the followings. So I get very confused by the suggestion that "… things that could have been done better instead of oscillating between both in an incoherent manner", which I don’t know what "both" refers to without being provided any examples.
   a. "Interesting but lacking originality"
   b. "Relevant discussion of sufficient detail to allow the reader to develop a clear understanding of the topic"
   c. Difficult to be certain what the key message is and how the conclusion relates to it.
6. "The rubric looks a bit different from the one provided" is another careless comment without specifying any examples.

I can’t speak for other parts of our report, mainly because my teammates are in charge of the rest parts. But the comments on the first two sections are not well made, nor are they well supported by elaborations. I hope that I can get more specific examples instead of just receiving a comment without explanations, so that I can know where I did poorly and where to improve in the future.

Thank you very much and I’m looking forward to your reply!

(PS: Most likely that you are not the one marking our essay, but I cannot find the email of the marker, so I write it directly to our tutors and lecturer. Or if you can provide us with the email or forward this to the tutor marking our essay, that’d be great!)

Regards,
Tian(Phillip) - Group 10
